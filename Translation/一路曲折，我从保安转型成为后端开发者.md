#### 一路曲折，我从保安转型成为后端开发者 #
我从小就喜欢
As a kid, I was in love with computers. But I didn’t get a high enough score on the college entrance exams to get into a computer-related field. So I studied mining engineering.
After one particularly bad semester where I failed my courses, I decided to take a summer job as a security guard to make some money. Well, that summer job went on to become my career.
